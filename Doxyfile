# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           = website/doxygen/logo.svg

# when the HTML document is shown. Doxygen will copy the logo to the output
# directory.

PROJECT_ICON           = website/doxygen/logo.svg

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
# path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
# header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of
# the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should
# specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the compiler
# using the -I flag.

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that act as commands in
# the documentation. An alias has the form:
# name=value
# For example adding
# "sideeffect=@par Side Effects:^^"
# will allow you to put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the
# documentation, which will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading
# "Side Effects:". Note that you cannot put \n's in the value part of an alias
# to insert newlines (in the resulting output). You can put ^^ in the value part
# of an alias to insert a newline as if a physical newline was in the original
# file. When you need a literal { or } or , in the value part of an alias you
# have to escape them by means of a backslash (\), this can lead to conflicts
# with the commands \{ and \} for these it is advised to use the version @{ and
# @} or use a double escape (\\{ and \\})

# The MARKDOWN_ID_STYLE tag can be used to specify the algorithm used to
# generate identifiers for the Markdown headings. Note: Every identifier is
# unique.
# Possible values are: DOXYGEN use a fixed 'autotoc_md' string followed by a
# sequence number starting at 0 and GITHUB use the lower case version of title
# with any whitespace replaced by '-' and punctuation characters removed.

# The NUM_PROC_THREADS specifies the number of threads Doxygen is allowed to use
# during processing. When set to 0 Doxygen will based this on the number of
# cores available in the system. You can set it explicitly to a value larger
# than 0 to get more control over the balance between CPU load and processing
# speed. At this moment only the input processing can be done using multiple
# threads. Since this is still an experimental feature the default is set to 1,
# which effectively disables parallel processing. Please report any issues you

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

# This tag can be used to specify the character encoding of the source files
# that Doxygen parses. The INPUT_FILE_ENCODING tag can be used to specify
# character encoding on a per file pattern basis. Doxygen will compare the file
# name with each pattern and apply the encoding instead of the default
# INPUT_ENCODING if there is a match. The character encodings are a list of the
# form: pattern=encoding (like *.php=ISO-8859-1).
# See also: INPUT_ENCODING for further information on supported encodings.

# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_OUTPUT            = .

# The HTML_HEADER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML header file for
# each generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank Doxygen will generate a
# standard header.
#
# To get valid HTML the header file that includes any scripts and style sheets
# that Doxygen needs, which is dependent on the configuration options used (e.g.
# the setting GENERATE_TREEVIEW). It is highly recommended to start with a
# default header using
# doxygen -w html new_header.html new_footer.html new_stylesheet.css
# YourConfigFile
# and then modify the file new_header.html. See also section "Doxygen usage"
# for information on how to generate the default header that Doxygen normally
# uses.
# Note: The header is subject to change so you typically have to regenerate the
# default header when upgrading to a newer version of Doxygen. For a description
# of the possible markers and block names see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_HEADER            = website/doxygen/header.html

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML footer for each
# generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank Doxygen will generate a standard
# footer. See HTML_HEADER for more information on how to generate a default
# footer and what special commands can be used inside the footer. See also
# section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to generate the default footer
# that Doxygen normally uses.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_FOOTER            = website/doxygen/footer.html

# The HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify additional user-defined
# cascading style sheets that are included after the standard style sheets
# created by Doxygen. Using this option one can overrule certain style aspects.
# This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET since it does not replace the
# standard style sheet and is therefore more robust against future updates.
# Doxygen will copy the style sheet files to the output directory.
# Note: The order of the extra style sheet files is of importance (e.g. the last
# style sheet in the list overrules the setting of the previous ones in the
# list).
# Note: Since the styling of scrollbars can currently not be overruled in
# Webkit/Chromium, the styling will be left out of the default doxygen.css if
# one or more extra stylesheets have been specified. So if scrollbar
# customization is desired it has to be added explicitly. For an example see the

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE tag can be used to specify if the generated HTML output
# should be rendered with a dark or light theme.
# Possible values are: LIGHT always generates light mode output, DARK always
# generates dark mode output, AUTO_LIGHT automatically sets the mode according
# to the user preference, uses light mode if no preference is set (the default),
# AUTO_DARK automatically sets the mode according to the user preference, uses
# dark mode if no preference is set and TOGGLE allows a user to switch between

HTML_COLORSTYLE        = LIGHT

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE tag controls the color of the HTML output. Doxygen
# will adjust the colors in the style sheet and background images according to
# this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a color-wheel, see
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information. For instance the value
# 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is blue, 300
# purple, and 360 is red again.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 359, default value: 220.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE    = 0

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT tag controls the purity (or saturation) of the colors
# in the HTML output. For a value of 0 the output will use gray-scales only. A
# value of 255 will produce the most vivid colors.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 255, default value: 100.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT    = 88

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA tag controls the gamma correction applied to the
# luminance component of the colors in the HTML output. Values below 100
# gradually make the output lighter, whereas values above 100 make the output
# darker. The value divided by 100 is the actual gamma applied, so 80 represents
# a gamma of 0.8, The value 220 represents a gamma of 2.2, and 100 does not
# change the gamma.
# Minimum value: 40, maximum value: 240, default value: 80.

HTML_COPY_CLIPBOARD    = NO

# With HTML_INDEX_NUM_ENTRIES one can control the preferred number of entries
# shown in the various tree structured indices initially; the user can expand
# and collapse entries dynamically later on. Doxygen will expand the tree to
# such a level that at most the specified number of entries are visible (unless
# a fully collapsed tree already exceeds this amount). So setting the number of
# entries 1 will produce a full collapsed tree by default. 0 is a special value
# representing an infinite number of entries and will result in a full expanded
# tree by default.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 9999, default value: 100.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_INDEX_NUM_ENTRIES = 1

# If you want full control over the layout of the generated HTML pages it might
# be necessary to disable the index and replace it with your own. The
# DISABLE_INDEX tag can be used to turn on/off the condensed index (tabs) at top
# of each HTML page. A value of NO enables the index and the value YES disables
# it. Since the tabs in the index contain the same information as the navigation
# tree, you can set this option to YES if you also set GENERATE_TREEVIEW to YES.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

DISABLE_INDEX          = NO

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine tune the look of the index (see "Fine-tuning the output"). As an
# example, the default style sheet generated by Doxygen has an example that
# shows how to put an image at the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME.
# Since the tree basically has the same information as the tab index, you could
# consider setting DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

# The ENUM_VALUES_PER_LINE tag can be used to set the number of enum values that
