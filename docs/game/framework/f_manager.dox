@class fManager_c
@details
## Overview
fManager_c manages the execution of base operations (called "processes" by Nintendo) both at a local
and a global scale. It also offers a small base search API.

## Global Base Searching
Bases can be searched globally based on various criteria:
- Use ::searchBaseByID to find a base by its @ref fBase_c::mUniqueID "unique identifier".
- Use ::searchBaseByProfName to find bases using a certain @ref fProfile::PROFILE_NAME_e
"profile name".
- Use ::searchBaseByGroupType to find bases belonging to the given @ref fBase_c::GROUP_TYPE_e
"group type".
- The last two functions allow specifying a base to start the search from, in order to narrow
down its scope.

For iterating the base tree manually, please refer to @xlink{./classfBase__c.html#iterating-bases,
fBase_c}.

## Operation Management
<i>For further details regarding operations, see @xlink{./classfBase__c.html#base-lifecycle,
fBase_c}.</i>

At a global scale, fManager_c handles operation execution through multiple linked lists. Each
list is dedicated to a specific operation, and contains all the bases for which the operation
is scheduled for the current frame.

The ::mainLoop function goes through each list and carries out the associated operation
on every base contained within, by calling the list's @ref fLiMgPTMF_c::walkPack "walkPack" method.
The execution order is as follows:
- @p delete
- @p create
- @p execute
- @p draw
- @p connect

Finally, an operation can be disabled globally by setting the ::m_StopProcInf flag. Disabling all
operations effectively halts the game, which can be useful for debugging.

## Implementation
Every instance of fManager_c is embedded inside a base, also known as its owner. The class
contains various list/tree nodes that link the owner base to the respective list/trees:
- ::mConnectNode connects the base to the @ref ::m_connectManage "connect tree", which allows it to
establish relationships with other bases. It is used during the @p connect operation.
- ::mMainNode allows the base to be scheduled for the @p create, @p execute and @p delete operations.
- ::mDrawNode allows the base to be scheduled for the @p draw operation.
- ::mSearchNode adds the base to one of the @ref ::m_searchManage "eight search lists", allowing it
to be indexed and searched for through the previously mentioned API.

## Unused Content
The aforementioned ::m_StopProcInf flag, while present and working, remains unchanged throughout
the whole game. Since its default value has no effects, it ultimately winds up unused.
