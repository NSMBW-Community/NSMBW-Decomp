/**
 * @brief Represents the header of the game's save file.
 * @ingroup bases
 * @details
 * The save file header contains data that is not related to a specific save slot, along with basic
 * information required to identify the data and preserve its integrity. For the slot-specific save data,
 * refer to dMj2dGame_c.
 *
 * ## Contents
 * The header is composed by the following fields:
 * - A region-dependent @ref mMagic "magic value". A mismatch (for example, by importing a savefile from
 * another region) will cause the save to be marked as corrupted.
 * - A @ref mRevision "major and minor revision number":
 *  - A different major revision number will cause the version to be updated silently
 * (see ::versionUpdate for details).
 *  - A different minor revision number will not trigger any action.
 * - The @ref mLastSelectedFile "last selected file". It is updated automatically when loading a save slot.
 * - The play count for each level in both @ref mPlayCountFreeMode "free mode" and
 * @ref mPlayCountCoinBattle "coin battle". The values are incremented by 100 every time a level is played,
 * up to a maximum of 10000. It is unknown why this specific convention was chosen.
 * - The @ref mMultiWorldOpenFlag "unlocked worlds" in Extra Modes. This bitfield is determined by checking
 * if each world is unlocked in at least one of the story mode files.
 * - A @ref mChecksum "CRC32 checksum" of all the above data, minus the magic. A mismatch (for example, by
 * hex editing the save file and forgetting to update this value) will cause the save to be marked as
 * corrupted.
 * @hint{User changes to the above structure must preserve the 32 byte alignment boundary. This is a
 * NAND level restriction.}
 *
 * ### Modifying the Contents
 * Read/write access to the fields related to Extra Modes is provided through dedicated functions. All other
 * fields are handled automatically by the game, therefore developer interaction is not required.
 * @note Changes to data stored in this class are temporary, unless the save is flushed to NAND. This can be
 * achieved through the dSaveMng_c class.
 *
 * ### Resetting the Contents
 * To reset the contents of the header, call the ::initialize function.
